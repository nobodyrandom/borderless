                    BORDERLESS is a grassroots, non-partisan, non-profit organization which uses creative means of
                    expression to draw attention to, educate on, and raise funds for often overlooked internally displaced
                    persons (IDP) and refugee crises around the world by bringing together people of various backgrounds.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    Our long-term vision is to be able to provide medical and general assistance to areas in immediate need.
                    Funds raised by BORDERLESS and other student clubs, societies, and organizations would be sent to
                    regions with large numbers of refugees that do not receive sufficient aid.

                <h5>
                    BORDERLESS evolved from the fact that Ukrainian refugees and IDPs were being overshadowed by the
                    geopolitics of the recent war. Initially, the purpose of this project was to fundraise for a cause
                    important to every member of our team, with a direct connection to the country for one. However, by
                    bringing the Ukrainian refugee crisis to the forefront, there was the realization that there are other
                    crises that are not receiving enough attention.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    As a result, we are committed to spotlighting a different refugee crisis every year, to bring it the
                    attention it deserves.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    Today, our team consists of University of Toronto undergraduate students who all agree that the severity
                    of the issue is disproportionate to the attention it is receiving. We share a common goal of putting the
                    people first. This year, we are partnering with UNHCR in order to better facilitate the aid of those
                    directly affected by the crisis.

                <h5>
                    BORDERLESS originated as a fundraising and social advocacy program with the assistance of the non-profit
                    organization Broadening Horizons. Through their 2014/2015 Making It Happen program they provided both
                    leadership development and a micro-grant to help us launch our initiative.

                <h5>
                    One of our primary challenges was finding a simple, yet effective way of expressing our mission through
                    our logo. We wanted a logo that didn’t require too much thinking to understand, yet wasn’t as cliché as
                    a globe with no political borders drawn. However, we wanted to stick to the idea of a globe and same
                    time, convey the message of "borderless". The mission is to assist refugees, of whatever country of
                    origin and wherever they may be, in an attempt to focus on alleviating their plight without any
                    political consideration.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    This logo is our attempt at abolishing borders in every sense. Continents and the oceans between then
                    can be considered borders, as they separate nations and peoples using natural geographical lines. This
                    logo shows no continents, with no such boundaries between the people. This logo portrays a world in
                    which there are no geographical divides between north and south, east and west. The strip of land
                    encompasses the circumference of the globe, connecting everyone in the true sense of being a world
                    without borders.
